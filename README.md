# Birthday Cake

## Anaconda

Should be able to use `environment.yml` to setup a conda environment to be able to run `main.py`:
```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If changes are made to the environment they can be saved with:
```
$ conda env export > environment_droplet.yml
```

## Fonts

`main.py` references a system font `Seven Segment` which can be downloaded from: https://www.dafont.com/seven-segment.font

How to install this font will vary based on your OS

## Quitting

Pressing the *Escape* key will cause the program to exit.
